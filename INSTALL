INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR Fudge-PyC
=============================================================================

The build process has been tested on OS X Lion (64bit) and Redhat Linux 2.6
(32bit); against Python 2.5 and 2.7. Any modern version of Python 2.x on a
Unix-like environment should be sypported.


Building the package on a Unix-like system
------------------------------------------

The package depends on Fudge-C and Python; so ensure that both of these are
installed. As Fudge-PyC uses distutils the build process is the standard one
for Python modules:

  $ python setup.py build

This assumes that Fudge-C has been installed in a standard location (usually
/usr/include and /usr/lib). If the library is in a non-standard location pass
the additional build flags to build_ext (not build, it won't accept them);
then run the main build target as normal. For example:

  $ python setup.py build_ext -I/usr/local/fudgec/include \
                              -L/usr/local/fudgec/lib \
                              -R/usr/local/fudgec/lib
  $ python setup.py build

The Fudge-PyC package contains unittests (that are based off the Fudge-Cpp
test suite). These can be run with the non-standard target test:

  $ python setup.py test

More verbose test output (standard Python unittest text output)  will be
produced if the target is run with the verbose flag:

  $ python setup.py -v test

To install the package the install target is used. As most system directories
are owned by root it will be necessary to run this as a super-user or via the
sudo command:

  $ sudo python setup.py install

If the installation has been successful then the following should run without
error:

  $ python
  >>> import fudgepyc
  >>> import fudgepyc.types
  >>> fudgepyc.init ( )

The usual distutils options are available, such as --prefix if you don't want
the package to be installed in the site-packages directory. More details can
be found using:

  $ python setup.py --help
