This is Fudge-PyC, a Python wrapper around the Fudge-C library. Fudge-C
being a C implementation of the Fudge message encoding system. Full details
of Fudge, including the specification, can be found at

    http://fudgemsg.org/

In brief: Fudge is a hierarchical, typesafe, binary, self-describing message
encoding specification.

    Hierarchical:
        Fudge messages aren't just a flat structure, they can be nested,
        creating larger, more complex data structures.

    Typesafe:
        Individual fields in a Fudge message are provided with their type data
        encoded, so that you can extract data safely.

    Binary:
        Fudge encoded data is binary, making it much smaller than text-based
        representations like XML or JSON.

    Self-Describing:
        Fudge messages contain metadata about the fields encoded (like a name
        or an ordinal), meaning that you can manipulate them without knowing
        the schema in advance.

    Message:
        Fudge was originally designed for encoding data to pass in a Message
        Oriented Middleware system, and so are more suited to the types of
        objects likely to be transmitted over a network connection than to a

Fudge-PyC wraps the native implementation to provide an interface that is
similar to Fudge-C, but using Python idioms (such as exceptions rather than
return values).
